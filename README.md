# OWASP Bug Bounty for Projects

##Introduction
Many developers and companies looking to implement security are turning towards OWASP to use Defender libraries that they can implement to secure their critical applications. Since this implies a form of trust in OWASP, many users of these projects might forget or not be aware that many of them are Open Source and lack an expected security assurance review, which at the moment is not done by OWASP.

##Repository
This repository contains web applications protected by OWASP projects that are running a Bug Bounty.
Researchers can download and run locally these applications in order to test their security.
