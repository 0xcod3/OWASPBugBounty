#OWASP Java Encoder Bug Bounty

This simple web application is hosting a single web form that is protected from XSS by the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project">OWASP Java Encoder Project</a>. This form will accept input in a variety of different contents in an HTML document and then render that input properly encoded in the reponse.

##Details

The OWASP Java Encoder is a Java 1.5+ simple-to-use drop-in high-performance encoder class with no dependencies and little baggage. This project will help Java web developers defend against Cross Site Scripting!
